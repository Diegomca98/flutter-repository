## Apps Developed
### 1. I Am Rich
This project is based on the functionality of the I Am Rich original app, with the sole purpose of showing the most basic functionality and structure of the Dart language and the Flutter framework.

I Am Rich is a 2008 mobile app for iPhones which had minimal function and was priced at US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,359 in 2022). The app was pulled from the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch. Receiving poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold. In the years since, several similar applications have been released at lower prices.

  #### 27. Working with Assets in Flutter & the Pubspec file
  1. Image()
     * AssetImage('images/diamond.png'),

  #### Section 4: Running Your App on a Physical Device
  1. Enable Developer Mode
     * Settings > Search for Build number
     * Tap the Build Number until you get the pop up saying that you're now a developer
  2. Go to Developer options and enable USB Debugging
  3. Connect the Phone with USB
  4. Trust Your Computer if Prompted
  5. Run App in your Phone

  * Notes:
     * If needed you can check -> <a href="https://blog.londonappbrewery.com/troubleshooting-android-device-testing-on-windows-a2b5d779df08">Troubleshooting Android Device Testing</a>

### 2. I Am Poor - App Challenge
This project is a counterpart of the I Am Rich app developed from Section 1 through Section 4 in order to test our learning from the previous sections.

I Am Rich is a 2008 mobile app for iPhones which had minimal function and was priced at US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,359 in 2022). The app was pulled from the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch. Receiving poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold. In the years since, several similar applications have been released at lower prices.

  <summary>I Am Poor - Notes</summary>
  
  #### Section 5: I Am Poor - App Challenge
  Using what you have learnt from the I Am Rich app, you'll be building a simple Flutter app from scratch. If you head over to this link, you can download the Widget tree structure:

  <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1DcvqcMiRD9GA9Cci9akfSMDfPd9Nrn3e">Widget Tree Structure</a>

  Using the Widget tree structure, create an app called I Am Poor, using everything you have learnt so far. Try to customise the app as much as you can to make it your own!

  You can use your own images, or simply find one from the internet.

### 3. My Card

#### Our Goal
Now that you've seen how to create a Flutter app entirely from scratch, we're going to go further and learn more about how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps.

#### What you will create
Mi Card is a personal business card. Imagine every time you wanted to give someone your contact details or your business card but you didn't have it on you. Well, now you can get them to download your business card as an app.

#### What you will learn
* How to create Stateless Widgets
* What is the difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold
* How to use Containers to lay out your UI
* How to use Columns and Rows to position your UI elements
* How to add custom fonts
* How to add Material icons
* How to style Text widgets
* How to read and use Flutter Documentation

<details>
  <summary>My Card - Notes</summary>

  ## 40. Hot Reload and Hot Restart - Flutter Power Tools
  Notes:
   * In order for the Hot Reload to work the widgets should be inside of a Stateful or a Stateless widget
  
  ## 41. How to Use Container Widgets
  Documentation:
   * <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets">Widget Catalog</a>
   * <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/layout">Layout Widgets</a>
  <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html">Container Class Widget</a>

  Notes:
   * A <b>layout</b> is the way in which the parts of something are arranged or laid out.
   * In Flutter there are multi-child and single-child layout widgets
     * A container is a single-child widget
     * Rows and Columns are multi-child widgets
   * A container widget is basically a box or a div when you see it from the web developer perspective.
