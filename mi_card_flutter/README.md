  ## 40. Hot Reload and Hot Restart - Flutter Power Tools
  Notes:
   * In order for the Hot Reload to work the widgets should be inside of a Stateful or a Stateless widget
  
  ## 41. How to Use Container Widgets
  Documentation:
   * <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets">Widget Catalog</a>
   * <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/layout">Layout Widgets</a>
  <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html">Container Class Widget</a>

  Notes:
   * A <b>layout</b> is the way in which the parts of something are arranged or laid out.
   * In Flutter there are multi-child and single-child layout widgets
     * A container is a single-child widget
     * Rows and Columns are multi-child widgets
   * A container widget is basically a box or a div when you see it from the web developer perspective.
