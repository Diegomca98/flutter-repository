# I Am Poor - App Challenge
This project is a counterpart of the I Am Rich app developed from Section 1 through Section 4 in order to test our learning from the previous sections.

I Am Rich is a 2008 mobile app for iPhones which had minimal function and was priced at US$999.99 (equivalent to $1,359 in 2022). The app was pulled from the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch. Receiving poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold. In the years since, several similar applications have been released at lower prices.

  #### Section 5: I Am Poor - App Challenge
  Using what you have learnt from the I Am Rich app, you'll be building a simple Flutter app from scratch. If you head over to this link, you can download the Widget tree structure:

  Using the Widget tree structure, create an app called I Am Poor, using everything you have learnt so far. Try to customise the app as much as you can to make it your own!

  You can use your own images, or simply find one from the internet.
